\begin{DoxyVerb}  ==============================================================================
                      ##### DAC Peripheral features #####
  ==============================================================================
    [..]
      *** DAC Channels ***
      ====================
    [..]
    STM32F4 devices integrate two 12-bit Digital Analog Converters

    The 2 converters (i.e. channel1 & channel2)
    can be used independently or simultaneously (dual mode):
      (#) DAC channel1 with DAC_OUT1 (PA4) as output
      (#) DAC channel2 with DAC_OUT2 (PA5) as output

      *** DAC Triggers ***
      ====================
    [..]
    Digital to Analog conversion can be non-triggered using DAC_TRIGGER_NONE
    and DAC_OUT1/DAC_OUT2 is available once writing to DHRx register.
    [..]
    Digital to Analog conversion can be triggered by:
      (#) External event: EXTI Line 9 (any GPIOx_PIN_9) using DAC_TRIGGER_EXT_IT9.
          The used pin (GPIOx_PIN_9) must be configured in input mode.

      (#) Timers TRGO: TIM2, TIM4, TIM5, TIM6, TIM7 and TIM8
          (DAC_TRIGGER_T2_TRGO, DAC_TRIGGER_T4_TRGO...)

      (#) Software using DAC_TRIGGER_SOFTWARE

      *** DAC Buffer mode feature ***
      ===============================
      [..]
      Each DAC channel integrates an output buffer that can be used to
      reduce the output impedance, and to drive external loads directly
      without having to add an external operational amplifier.
      To enable, the output buffer use
      sConfig.DAC_OutputBuffer = DAC_OUTPUTBUFFER_ENABLE;
      [..]
      (@) Refer to the device datasheet for more details about output
          impedance value with and without output buffer.

       *** DAC wave generation feature ***
       ===================================
       [..]
       Both DAC channels can be used to generate
         (#) Noise wave
         (#) Triangle wave

       *** DAC data format ***
       =======================
       [..]
       The DAC data format can be:
         (#) 8-bit right alignment using DAC_ALIGN_8B_R
         (#) 12-bit left alignment using DAC_ALIGN_12B_L
         (#) 12-bit right alignment using DAC_ALIGN_12B_R

       *** DAC data value to voltage correspondence ***
       ================================================
       [..]
       The analog output voltage on each DAC channel pin is determined
       by the following equation:
       [..]
       DAC_OUTx = VREF+ * DOR / 4095
       (+) with  DOR is the Data Output Register
       [..]
          VREF+ is the input voltage reference (refer to the device datasheet)
       [..]
        e.g. To set DAC_OUT1 to 0.7V, use
       (+) Assuming that VREF+ = 3.3V, DAC_OUT1 = (3.3 * 868) / 4095 = 0.7V

       *** DMA requests ***
       =====================
       [..]
       A DMA request can be generated when an external trigger (but not a software trigger)
       occurs if DMA1 requests are enabled using HAL_DAC_Start_DMA().
       DMA1 requests are mapped as following:
      (#) DAC channel1 mapped on DMA1 Stream5 channel7 which must be 
          already configured
      (#) DAC channel2 mapped on DMA1 Stream6 channel7 which must be 
          already configured

     [..]
    (@) For Dual mode and specific signal (Triangle and noise) generation please
        refer to Extended Features Driver description

                      ##### How to use this driver #####
  ==============================================================================
    [..]
      (+) DAC APB clock must be enabled to get write access to DAC
          registers using HAL_DAC_Init()
      (+) Configure DAC_OUTx (DAC_OUT1: PA4, DAC_OUT2: PA5) in analog mode.
      (+) Configure the DAC channel using HAL_DAC_ConfigChannel() function.
      (+) Enable the DAC channel using HAL_DAC_Start() or HAL_DAC_Start_DMA() functions.


     *** Polling mode IO operation ***
     =================================
     [..]
       (+) Start the DAC peripheral using HAL_DAC_Start()
       (+) To read the DAC last data output value, use the HAL_DAC_GetValue() function.
       (+) Stop the DAC peripheral using HAL_DAC_Stop()

     *** DMA mode IO operation ***
     ==============================
     [..]
       (+) Start the DAC peripheral using HAL_DAC_Start_DMA(), at this stage the user specify the length
           of data to be transferred at each end of conversion
           First issued trigger will start the conversion of the value previously set by HAL_DAC_SetValue().
       (+) At the middle of data transfer HAL_DAC_ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh1() or HAL_DACEx_ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh2()
           function is executed and user can add his own code by customization of function pointer
           HAL_DAC_ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh1() or HAL_DACEx_ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh2()
       (+) At The end of data transfer HAL_DAC_ConvCpltCallbackCh1() or HAL_DACEx_ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh2()
           function is executed and user can add his own code by customization of function pointer
           HAL_DAC_ConvCpltCallbackCh1() or HAL_DACEx_ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh2()
       (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_DAC_ErrorCallbackCh1() function is executed and user can
            add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_DAC_ErrorCallbackCh1
       (+) In case of DMA underrun, DAC interruption triggers and execute internal function HAL_DAC_IRQHandler.
           HAL_DAC_DMAUnderrunCallbackCh1() or HAL_DACEx_DMAUnderrunCallbackCh2()
           function is executed and user can add his own code by customization of function pointer
           HAL_DAC_DMAUnderrunCallbackCh1() or HAL_DACEx_DMAUnderrunCallbackCh2() and
           add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_DAC_ErrorCallbackCh1()
       (+) Stop the DAC peripheral using HAL_DAC_Stop_DMA()

    *** Callback registration ***
    =============================================
    [..]
      The compilation define  USE_HAL_DAC_REGISTER_CALLBACKS when set to 1
      allows the user to configure dynamically the driver callbacks.

    Use Functions HAL_DAC_RegisterCallback() to register a user callback,
      it allows to register following callbacks:
      (+) ConvCpltCallbackCh1     : callback when a half transfer is completed on Ch1.
      (+) ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh1 : callback when a transfer is completed on Ch1.
      (+) ErrorCallbackCh1        : callback when an error occurs on Ch1.
      (+) DMAUnderrunCallbackCh1  : callback when an underrun error occurs on Ch1.
      (+) ConvCpltCallbackCh2     : callback when a half transfer is completed on Ch2.
      (+) ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh2 : callback when a transfer is completed on Ch2.
      (+) ErrorCallbackCh2        : callback when an error occurs on Ch2.
      (+) DMAUnderrunCallbackCh2  : callback when an underrun error occurs on Ch2.
      (+) MspInitCallback         : DAC MspInit.
      (+) MspDeInitCallback       : DAC MspdeInit.
      This function takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle, the Callback ID
      and a pointer to the user callback function.

    Use function HAL_DAC_UnRegisterCallback() to reset a callback to the default
      weak (surcharged) function. It allows to reset following callbacks:
      (+) ConvCpltCallbackCh1     : callback when a half transfer is completed on Ch1.
      (+) ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh1 : callback when a transfer is completed on Ch1.
      (+) ErrorCallbackCh1        : callback when an error occurs on Ch1.
      (+) DMAUnderrunCallbackCh1  : callback when an underrun error occurs on Ch1.
      (+) ConvCpltCallbackCh2     : callback when a half transfer is completed on Ch2.
      (+) ConvHalfCpltCallbackCh2 : callback when a transfer is completed on Ch2.
      (+) ErrorCallbackCh2        : callback when an error occurs on Ch2.
      (+) DMAUnderrunCallbackCh2  : callback when an underrun error occurs on Ch2.
      (+) MspInitCallback         : DAC MspInit.
      (+) MspDeInitCallback       : DAC MspdeInit.
      (+) All Callbacks
      This function) takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle and the Callback ID.

      By default, after the HAL_DAC_Init and if the state is HAL_DAC_STATE_RESET
      all callbacks are reset to the corresponding legacy weak (surcharged) functions.
      Exception done for MspInit and MspDeInit callbacks that are respectively
      reset to the legacy weak (surcharged) functions in the HAL_DAC_Init
      and  HAL_DAC_DeInit only when these callbacks are null (not registered beforehand).
      If not, MspInit or MspDeInit are not null, the HAL_DAC_Init and HAL_DAC_DeInit
      keep and use the user MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks (registered beforehand)

      Callbacks can be registered/unregistered in READY state only.
      Exception done for MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks that can be registered/unregistered
      in READY or RESET state, thus registered (user) MspInit/DeInit callbacks can be used
      during the Init/DeInit.
      In that case first register the MspInit/MspDeInit user callbacks
      using HAL_DAC_RegisterCallback before calling HAL_DAC_DeInit
      or HAL_DAC_Init function.

      When The compilation define USE_HAL_DAC_REGISTER_CALLBACKS is set to 0 or
      not defined, the callback registering feature is not available
      and weak (surcharged) callbacks are used.

     *** DAC HAL driver macros list ***
     =============================================
